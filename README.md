# Questions about `pull-request`
 
- Is there any example (repository, organization, ...) that shows the use of pull-requests in a classroom?
- Do you think it would be easier to explain people with no technical background the use of git workflow using an IDE (like Fork) more than using terminal commands?
- I'd like to use github classroom to organize all kinds of exercises for all types of audiences (non-technical included). What do you think (in your experience) that would be a better (easier to understand and apply for them)approach for this?
